# Resume-With-Feedback-Option
This is a resume template using pure HTML and CSS. I also added a feedback page to receive feedback from users. You can use  xampp to run the index page in a web browser. Follow the steps below:
**Step-1:**
Unzip the zip file after downloading on your local device and transfer the folder to the htdocs folder of the installation directory of xampp.
**Step-2:**
Edit the HTML index file and add your information. 
**Step-3:**
Run the index page in a web browser to use the feedback form. You can open it through localhost/your_index_file_repository in my case it is(http://localhost/Resume-With-Feedback-Option/index.html). Watch any youtube video if needed.
